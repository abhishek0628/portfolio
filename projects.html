                    <p>This project implements real-time object detection 
                      using Python and machine learning concepts, 
                      leveraging popular libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. 
                      The system is designed to identify and track multiple objects in a video feed, 
                      making it applicable for use in various fields such as surveillance,
                      autonomous vehicles, and robotics.

                      This project uses Python and machine learning techniques 
                      to detect differences between two images. 
                      It focuses on identifying pixel-level changes, 
                      which can be useful for various applications such as comparing images 
                      for security, quality control, change detection in satellite imagery, 
                      or version control in image data.
